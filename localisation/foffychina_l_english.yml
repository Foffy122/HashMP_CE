 foffychina.1.t:0 "Li Shun"
 foffychina.1.d:0 "The Shun Warlord has humble origins. Li Shun, also known as ‘The Prodigy’ was born in a village of farmers located near Xi’an. In 1441, he was placed in a stockade by a local Ming magistrate named Chun Shen for failing to pay his family’s debts. Having been well-loved by the people and being one of the only educated villagers, he was surreptitiously freed during the night. Dissatisfaction with the Ming was at an all-time high, and he was easily able to raise a small force and escape Xi’an. Since the collapse of Ming, his number of followers has grown steadily. He now rules in Western Gansu and plots to re-take his home province of Shaanxi."
 foffychina.1.a:0 "For Shun!"
 foffychina.2.t:0 "Zhang Xi"
 foffychina.2.d:0 "Zhang Xi, also known as ‘The Tiger’ is a brutal warlord. He served in the Ming army until drought, famines, and epidemics brought the dynasty to its knees. Peasants who resisted efforts by the Ming government to continue to collect taxes and tithes revolted en-masse, coalescing into rebel armies that the Ming called ‘roving bandits’. Zhang Xi deserted the army when he realized that he could make a name for himself in this era of chaos. He came to lead a powerful rebel army and plundered the countryside extensively. With no organized force being powerful enough to stop him, he engaged in wholesale slaughter and destruction. As of 1444, he now controls the area of Biyang and plans to subjugate the rich cities of Wuchang and Changde."
 foffychina.2.a:0 "For Xi!"
 foffychina.3.t:0 "Meng Yi"
 foffychina.3.d:0 "The night after his father died, Meng Yi dreamt that he was a great dragon, laying waste to his foes and setting the land itself ablaze. When he awoke, the day had come for him to formally become tribal leader of the Yi people. Many expected him to follow in his father’s footsteps and rule peacefully, but Meng Yi had greater ambitions. He quickly unified the highlands that have traditionally been inhabited by the Yi, and he now sets his sights on the rich Sichuan Basin. Tales of ‘The Dragon’ are now told in hushed whispers in all corners of China, and all fear his coming."
 foffychina.3.a:0 "For Yi!"
 foffychina.4.t:0 "Huan Qi"
 foffychina.4.d:0 "Huan Qi, Master of the light and heavy, is widely considered to have been an unlikely candidate for the title of Warlord. Huan Qi was a famous philosopher and politician in the Ming court for many years. His knowledge of fiscal policy and his skillful diplomacy eventually elevated him to the rank of Grand Chancellor. A few months before the fall of Beijing, he fled south to Jinan to escape the coming chaos. Many now look to him for leadership in these times of uncertainty. Having founded the State of Qi, The ‘Warlord Philosopher’ now seeks to reunite China and return peace to the land."
 foffychina.4.a:0 "For Qi!"
 foffychina.5.t:0 "Qian Wu"
 foffychina.5.d:0 "Even as a child, Qian Wu was a great general and had a shrewd intellect. He ordered the other children to march in formation and was always obeyed. When he came of age, he joined the local militia and defended his hometown from the large bandit and rebel forces that were plaguing the nearby circuits. When the time came for him to make a living, he went into the salt trade and moonlighted as a privateer. Now in his middle age, Qian Wu has a vast number of business contacts and old friends that he can call on. With the fall of the Ming, Qian Wu ‘The Magnate’ plans to make his fortune in both iron and gold."
 foffychina.5.a:0 "For Wu!"
 foffychina.6.t:0 "Goujian Yue"
 foffychina.6.d:0 "Goujian Yue is a humble man who just happens to rule one of the strongest successor states to the Ming dynasty. A true man of the people, he avoids indulging in luxury and instead prefers to sleep on sticks and eat food suited for peasants. These quirks often lead his enemies to underestimate him, but Goujian Yue is a true pragmatist, always appointing the best advisors and leading his men from the front. Before the fall of the Ming, he was a commander of the Yue prefecture, in charge of protecting the people from the barbarians to the south and west. Now, ‘The Hegemon’ plans to make his ambitions a reality by crushing all other Warlords and ruling China alone."
