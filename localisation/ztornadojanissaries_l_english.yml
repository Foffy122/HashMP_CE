 flavor_tur.EVTNAME222:0 "Janissary Marriages"
 flavor_tur.EVTDESC222:0 "Initially, the Janissaries were expected to be celibate and not marry. However, in 1566, Sultan Selim II allowed the Janissaries to take wives. This gave them exterior interests, and contributed to the trend of the Janissaries becoming a hereditary, entrenched political class rather than a strictly militaristic order."

 flavor_tur.EVTNAME223:0 "Janissary Conservatism"
 flavor_tur.EVTDESC223:0 "The Janissaries represented a heavily conservative element of the Ottoman military hierarchy, failing to adapt their strategies and tactics to changing times. By the early 17th century, the Janissaries were beginning to become outclassed by the armies of other states--Despite this, their significant influence in society remained."

 flavor_tur.EVTNAME224:0 "Janissary System Dysfunctional"
 flavor_tur.EVTDESC224:0 "By the late 1600s, the Devsirme system and the Janissaries had fallen far from their original grace. A total failure to keep the Janissaries in check throughout the years meant that they had a completely disproportionate influence on all matters within the Ottoman Empire, assassinating Sultans that attempted to control them and fully becoming a law unto themselves."

 flavor_tur.EVTNAME226:0 "Janissaries Assassinate Sultan"
 flavor_tur.EVTDESC226:0 "The Janissaries were not afraid to take drastic action to protect their interests if they were threatened. In 1622, Osman II was imprisoned and murdered by his own Janissaries. Nearly two hundred years later, Selim III would suffer a similar fate when he attempted to modernize the Ottoman army. A similar fate has befallen our Sultan and his chosen son; a rebellious faction of Janissaries stormed the royal chambers of the palace and the harem in the dead of night, cutting the throat of our Sultan and gouging out the eyes of his son. In their place, they've chosen an easily-manipulated fool with no merit to rule!"
 flavor_tur.EVTOPTA226:0 "We should've kept a closer eye on them..."
 flavor_tur.EVTNAME225:0 "Janissaries Support Claimant"
 flavor_tur.EVTDESC225:0 "The Janissaries began meddling in political affairs as their influence in the Ottoman Empire grew. Our supposedly loyal troops have thrown their support behind a new candidate to the throne, a young man with skills far from spectacular who seems to be a practical puppet of theirs."
